# Frontend Part

## 1. HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language

**Boilerplate**

sublime text: html + tab

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

**Header**

**&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt; &lt;h5&gt; &lt;h6&gt;**

**Inline**

&lt;em&gt; or &lt;i&gt;  Italic  
&lt;strong&gt; or &lt;b&gt;  Bold  
&lt;u&gt;  underline

#### List

**1.Ordered List**

```html
<ol>
    <li>point 1</li>
    <li>point 2</li>
    <li>point 3</li>
</ol>
```

**2. UnOrdered List**

```html
    <li>point 1</li>
    <li>point 2</li>
    <li>point 3</li>
</ul>
```

**General Container**

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   block level container

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  inline level container

#### HTML Attributes

Attributes add additional information to tags. It's in key-value pair form like &lt;tag name="content"&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;

name is the name of the attributes, content is the content of the attributes

&lt;a href="linkToGoogle"&gt;Go to Google&lt;/a&gt;  Insert a Link

&lt;img src=""&gt;  Insert an image

#### HTML Table

&lt;table border="1"&gt; &lt;/table&gt; define a table

&lt;thead&gt;&lt;/thead&gt; header of table

&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt; body of table

&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; a head for a colume

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; a single row of the table

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; a single cell of the table

```html
<table border="1">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
            <th>Breed</th>    
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Alice</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Poodle</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sam</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>Alaska</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

**compress images:** set the size of image smaller

**multiple cursors in sublime text:** click and press command, you can get multiple cursors

#### HTML Form

**form tags:** &lt;form action="send to this url" method="post"&gt;&lt;/form&gt; create a form. action attributes is the url the form will sent to. method attributes is the http method the form will send as.

**input tags:** &lt;input type="text"/"email"/"password"/"file"/"checkbox" placeholder="Password" name=""&gt;  input tag create interactive controls. The "type" attribute determines the type of input. The "placeholder" is the text that will show in the box.

**button tags:**&lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt; and &lt;input type="submit"&gt; will create a submit button

**label tags:** add captions to individual elements in the form, important to make the form accessible. There are two ways to add labels:

```html
<label>Username:<input type="text" placeholder="username" name="username"></label>
<label>Password:<input type="password" placeholder="password" name="password"></label>
```

```html
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input id="username" type="text" placeholder="username">
<label for="password">Password: </label>
<input id="password" type="password" placeholder="password">
```

**form validation:** "required" attribute validate that am input isn't empty

**radio box:** you can only choose one radio box under the same name

```html
<h1>Are you a boy or a girl?</h1>
<label for="girls">Girls:</label>
<input id="girls" type="radio" name="gender" value="girls">
<label for="boys">Boys: </label>
<input id="boys" type="radio" name=gender value="boys">
```

**select box:** you can have a scroll down select box

```html
<h1>Which color is your favorite?</h1>
<select name="color">
    <option value="yellow">Yellow</option>
    <option value="orange">Orange</option>
    <option value="red">Red</option>
</select>
```

**text area:** you can type in text within this region, "rows" and "cols" attributes set the size of the text area.

```html
<h1>Do you have any comments?</h1>
<textarea name="comments" rows="10" cols="50"></textarea>
```

**Canvas: **&lt;canvas&gt; element can be used to draw graphics via scripting in JavaScript, it can be used to draw graphs, create animations or video processing or rendering. In HTML, canvas just exist, it doesn't do anything. In JavaScript, we will shape it.

`<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>`

## 2. CSS - Cascading Style Sheet

**General Rule**

```css
selector {
    property:value;
}
```

**Connect CSS and HTML file **

Inline and style tag method are not very good method to add css to html. Inline will need to change every elements in the html even if they are in  the same style, it will be a very heavy work if the page is very large. The problem of style tag is that we want to separate css with html, we don't want css nested in html.

we want to add a link tag in html head tag \(sublime: link + tab\)

```html
<head>
    <title>Demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="filename.css">
</head>
```

**Color in CSS**

1.Hexadecimal: \# + 6 hexadecimal numbers\(0-F\)

6 hexadecimal numbers = RGB\(256, 256, 256\) \(Red + Green + Blue\)  `color:#FF0401;`

1. RGB: 3channels: Red, Green, Blue, each range from 0-255

`color:rgb(0,255,0);`

1. RGBA : like RGB, but with an alpha\(transparent\) channel, range from 0.0-1.0\(0.0 means total transparent\)

`color:rgba(11, 99, 150, 0.6)`

**Background**

we use color to set text color and use background to set background color. background could also set as an image.

```css
body {
    background: url(http://anguerde.com/pics/main/56/406435-wooden-wallpaper.jpg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
}
```

**Border**

border setting consists of three parts: color, width, style

```css
h1 {
    border: 2px dashed rgb(255,0,0);
}
OR
h1 {
    border-color: purple;
    border-width: 1px;
    border-style: solid/dashed;
}
```

#### Selector

**1.Element/ Type Selector**

```css
li {}  h1 {}  p{}
```

**2. ID - an unique id can only appear once in html page**

```css
#name{} #id{} #special{}
```

**3. Class - a class can be used many times**

```css
.completed{} .done{}
```

**4.** **Star - select every element in the page**

```css
*{}
```

**5. Descendant Selector -  the second element must nested in the first element**

```css
li a {} /*select all the <a> inside of <li>*/
p div {} /*select all <div> inside of <p>*/
```

**6. Adjacent Selector - the second element is next to the first element**

```css
h1 + h2 {} /*select all h2 that is adjacent to h1*/
```

**7. Attribute Selector - select all elements based on that attribute**

```css
tag[attribute="content"] {} /*select all tags with that attribute="content"*/
a[href="http://www.google.com"] {} /*select all <a> with href="http://www.google.com"*/
input[type="text"] {} /*select all <input> with type="text"*/
```

**8. nth of type - select the nth element of that type**

```css
ul:nth-of-type(3) {} /*select the 3rd ul*/
```

**9. Special Selectors**

```css
h1:hover {} /*change the style of h1 when mouse hover on it*/
h1:first-letter {} /*change the style of first letter of h1*/
a:visited{} /*change the style of a link if it's visited*/
input:checked{} /*change the style of a checkbox if it's checked*/
```

**Inheritance: **Children will inherit the css style of its parent.

**Specificity: **if there are more than one style targeting an element,  whichever selector that is more specific will win. To know which selector wins, we can use css specificity calculator.

Type selector &lt; class selector/attribute selector &lt; ID selector

#### Font

**1.font family**

font family property specifies a font name from the font family for the selected element. If font name have digit at the beginning, you must add double quotes to the font

```css
p {font-family: Arial} 
h1 {font-family: "1sansif"}
```

**2. font size**

one method to set font size is specifies the pixels of the font size. The other is using "em" values, it is relatively font size means dynamic. it will automatically adapts its length relative to the font that the reader choose to use. It might cause compounding problem. Another value is "rem", it is relative to the root html element\(default setting or personal setting\), not parent element. It let you specify a font size in a relative fashion without being affected by the size of the parent, thereby eliminating compounding problem.

em = desired element pixel value / parent element font-size in pixels

rem = desired element pixel value / root element font-size in pixels

```css
body {font-size: 10px;}
p {font-sizeï¼š2em;} /*value 2 is a multiplier of the current em size*/
div {font-size: 0.65rem} /*font size is 0.65 * body font size*/
```

**3. font weight**

font-weight specifies the boldness of the font. The values of this property are normal, bold, bolder, lighter, 100, 200, 300, ... , 800, 900.

**4. line height**

line height specifies the amount of space between lines. The value of this property are normal, 3.5, 3em, 50%

**5. text align**

text align specifies how the text is aligned. The value are right, center, left

**6. text decoration**

text decoration gives underline or line through or overline effect

#### **The Box Model**

In a document, each element is represented as a rectangular box. In CSS, each of this rectangular boxes is described using box model. Each box has four edges: the margin edge, border edge, padding edge and content edge.

![](https://www.codeproject.com/KB/HTML/567385/boxmodel-image.png)

**Content, Padding\(space between content and border\), Border, Margin\(space outside of border\)**

```css
p {
    /*content*/
    width: 100px;
    width: 50% /*50% of its parent element, if the window size change, the width of p will also change.*/ 
    height: 100px;
    /*padding*/
    padding: 100px;
    padding-top: 20px;
    padding-bottom : 30px;
    /*border*/
    border: 1px purple solid
    border-left: 1px black solid
    border-right: 2px orange dashed
    /*margin*/
    margin: 20px, 40px, 400px, 100px; /*top, right, bottom, left*/
    margin: 0 auto; /*top, right and repeat on bottom, left*/
    /*auto means that the value of that property is adjusted automatically according to the content*/
    margin-top: 20px; 
    }
```

#### Notice:

a percentage value for `height` doesnâ€™t work but a percentage value for `width` does.

In CSS an element's padding will be calculated by it's parent element's width if the padding is set using percent instead of pixels.

To center text, use `text-align: center`. To center box model, use `margin: 0 auto` + define width of the container.

`border-radius: 15%` can make the border have round effect

`transition: background 0.3s` will have fade out effect whenever the background is changed

## 3. Bootstrap

Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS and JS framework for designing website. You can download it and link to the file locally, or use CDN\(Content Distributed Network\)support, which is an online server for bootstrap, you just need to add a link to the html header.

**Button, Jumbotron, Navigation Bar**

**Form**

classes to make the form organized. _**".form-group"** \_add some spacing between each group of elements. _**".form-control" **_add focus effect, padding, border to the input tag. _**".form-inline"**\_ wrap the entire form in one line.

#### **Grid System**

Use grid to build layout by 12 column system.

**Container: **container provide a means to center and horizontally pad site's content**.**

**Rows: **wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding for controlling the space between them. This padding is counteracted on the rows with negative margins.

**Columns:** content must be placed within columns and only columns may be immediate children of rows. Columns without a specified width will automatically layout as equal width columns. Column width are set in percentages, so they're dynamic and sized relative to their parent element.

**Four Different Sizes: **Extra Small\(Phone\)         Small\(Tablet\)         Medium\(Desktop\)      Large\(Desktop\)

## 4. JavaScript

Link HTML and JavaScript file: use &lt;script src="url"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag, in sublime do script + tab

```html
<head>    
    <title>Demo</title>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</head>
```

#### Primitive Type

There are five primitive types: Numbers, Strings, Boolean, Null, Undefined.

**find console in chrome: **chrome -view- javascript console

**Numbers:** numbers include all kinds of form, eg. positive number, negative number, integer, float number

**String:** both single or double quote is ok for string. When there is a single quote in the string, we must use double quote, like `"I can't stop imagine".`

When we want to use double quote inside a string, use escape character "\" `"I know \"king of mine\" means" = "I know "king of mine" means".` When we want to use backslash, do `backslash \\" = backslash \`

**Boolean: **true and false. Value aren't actually true or false, are still inherently "truthy" or "falsey" when evaluated in a boolean context. Falsy value: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN.

```js
!!"" // false
!!NaN // false
!!"false" //true
!!-1 //true
// Falsy value: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN
//  everything else is truthy
```

**Comparison Operators:  **"==" equal to value, "!=" not equal to value, "===" equal value and type, "!==" not equal value or equal type.

"==" performs type coercion, while "=== does not."

```js
var a = 5; var b = "5"
a == b; // true
a != b; // false
a === b;  //False
a !== b; // true

var y = null;
y == undefined; //true
y === undefined; //false

true == "1"; //true
true == "12"; //false
false == "0"; //true
null == undefined; //true
NaN == NaN //false
// NaN: not a number
```

**Variable: **A container that stores different value, define a variable: `var name = value;`

In Javascript, variable name follows **camel case:** the first name is lowercase, next word be uppercase. eg. camelCase.

**snake case:** words are separated by \__. eg. \_snake_\_\_case

**kebab case:** words are separated by -. eg. kebab-case

**Dynamic Typing:** variable can change from one type to another.

```js
var name = 80;
name = "Sally"
name = "80" - 10 = "70"
```

**Cast Type:** If we want to convert a string to number, we can use Number\("80"\) to cast the type, or String\(90\), Boolean\("Helllo"\)

**Null: **explicitly nothing or empty

**Undefined: **Variables that are declared, but not initialized. If a variable is not declared at all, the system will throw an error message, not undefined value.

```js
var currentPlayer = "charlie";
currentPlayer = null;

//undefined
var name;
var age;

//throw reference error
color
```

#### Built in Methods

**alert\(content\): **pops up a message to alert user

**prompt\(content\): **get input from user

**console.log\(content\):** print something to javascript console

**clear\(\): **clear the javascript console

**typeof\(varName\):** return the type of this variable in string form

```js
alert("You can't open this page");
alert(900 * 40);
console.log("This can only show in console");
var username = prompt("what is your username?");
clear();
typeof(70); //"number"
typeof("false"); // "string"
```

#### Functions

functions are building blocks of JavaScript. It lets us wrap up code segment into reusable package.

```js
function playMusic() {
}
// playMusic means pass a function as a reference, but not execute it
// playMusic() means execute the function immediately
```

**Declaration & Expression**

The difference between declaration and expression is that if we use expression, once we reassign the variable name to another type, the function will be lost.

```js
// function declaration
function name(argument1, argument2) {
    return result;
}
// function expression, once assign the var name to another type, the function will be lost.
var name = function(argument1, argument2) {
    return result;
}
// Anonymous Function
function(argument1, argument2) {
    return result;
}
```

**Scope: **context that code is executed in. When we define a function, we had a new scope for that function. Child scope have access to variables in parent scope, but parent scope don't have access to child scope.

```js
var a = 4; var b = 9;
function doMath() {
    a = 5; 
    var b = 12;
    return a * a;
}
doMath(); // return 25
x; // return 5
y;// return 9
function doOther() {
    var y = 7;
    return 2 * y + 10; 
}
doOther(); // return 24
y; // throw error message
```

**Higher Order Function: **functions that are either pass a function as an argument or return a function

**Array: **group data in consecutive memory, we can retrieve, update, or add them by index. For empty space, the default value is undefined. If you access an index that is out of bound, it will return undefined. Array can hold any type of data.

```js
// Define an array
var array = [];
var array = new Array();
var friends = ["Charlie", false, null, 70];
friend.length; // return 4
```

**push/pop: **append or remove element to the end of the array

**unshift/shift**: add or remove element to the start of the array

**indexOf\(element\):** return the first index of that element in the array, if not exist, return -1.

**slice\(start index, end index\):** deep copy a part of the array, the original array won't be changed

**splice\(start index, number of element to be remove\): **remove element from array given index and range

**forEach\(function\): **iterate over the array. forEach\(\) takes in a callback function, it execute for each element in array. It has three argument: the element value, element index, the array being traversed. The syntax is like array.forEach\(function\(element, index, array\)\);

```js
var colors = ["Green", "Red", "Yellow", "Blue"];
colors.forEach(function(color, i){ // input is an anonymous function
    console.log(i + "th color is " + color); // color is a placeholder for element value, i is the index 
});
```

#### Object

Object store data in key-value pairs. Object can hold all sorts of data, eg. number, string, boolean, array, or object.

```js
// create a new object
var person = {}
var person = new Object();
var person = {name: "Travis", age: 21, city: "LA" }

// add element
person.age = 6;


// retrieve data using bracket or dot notation
person["name"];
person.name; 

// you can't use dot notation if the property name start with number or name with space
person.1house //Invalid
person.house wife //Invalid
person["1house"] // valid
person["house wife"] // valid

// you can't use dot notation for a variable
var str = "age";
person.str // Invalid, won't look for "age"
person[str] // valid, will look for "age"
```

**Methods: **we can add methods to object, it's like a a property of an object that is a function. We can customize the same method for different object. Same as polymorphism in java.

```js
var person = {name = "chunk" add: function(x, y) {return x + y;}};
person.add(30, 7); // return 37

// customize method for different object, avoid namespace collision
var cats = {speak: function(){return "MEOW!"}};
var dogs = {speak: function(){return "WOOF!"}};
cats.speak();
dogs.speak();
```

**"This" Keyword:** In an object, if we want to add a method and use the data of the object, we use "this" to represent this object.

```js
var movie = {title: "Titanic", comments: ["So Great", "Don't like it", "Excellent"]};
movie.printComments = function() {
    for (var i = 0; i < this.comments.length; i++) {
        console.log(this.comments[i]);
    }
}
movie.printComments();
```

## 4. DOM - Document Object Model

The DOM is the interface between Javascript and HTML + CSS. It all starts with the root node - document object. The process is that we first select an element, then manipulate it.

#### DOM Selector

The document object have many method to select element. The selector will return a javascript object.

**document.getElementById\(\) : **take a string argument as ID and return the one element with a matching ID.

**document.getElementsByClassName\(\): **take a string argument as class name and return a node list of elements with a matching class. The node list is not an array, can't use forEach function to iterate.

**document.getElementsByTagName\(\): **take a string argument as tag name, and return a node list of elements with a matching tag.

**document.querySelector\(\):** take a string argument as CSS-style selector, and return the first element that matches the selector. eg. "\#ID", ".class", ''tag", "li a"

**document.querySelectorAll\(\): **take a string argument as CSS-style selector, and return a list of all elements that matches the selector

#### Manipulation

**Style Property**: it's one way to manipulate an element. The style property allows for quick styling, eg testing. It's recommended for styles to be defined in a separate file. There is a concept of "separation of concerns", which includes three parts: structure\(HTML\), presentation\(CSS\), behavior\(Javascript\) to be separated.

classList is a read only list that contains the classes for a given element. It's not an array.We use add, remove, toggle to update it.

```js
// create a new CSS class
.highlight {
    color: red;
    border: 1px solid orange;
}

// select an element
var h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

// manipulate method 1
// add a class to that element classList
h1.classList.add("highlight");
// remove a class to that element classList
h1.classList.remove("highlight");
// if the class exist in classList, toggle will remove it from classList. 
// If it doesn't exist, toggle will add it to classList.
h1.classList.toggle("highlight");

// manipulate method 2
h1.style.color = "red";
h1.style.border = "1px solid orange";
```

**Text and Content: **there are two methods to change text and content

**element.textContent: **return an extract** **pure text without html tags inside that element as string.

**element.innerHTML:** return the html inside that element as string.

```js
var h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
// notice there is no ()
h1.textContent = "You are the best";
h1.innerHTML = "<em>You<em> are the <strong>best</strong>";
```

**Attributes:** there are two methods to read and write attributes.

**element.getAttribute\("attribute"\): **get the value of given attribute in the element.

**element.setAttribute\("attribute", "content"\): **set the value of given attribute in the element.

```js
//<a href="www.google.com">Link</a>
var link = document.querySelector("a");
link.getAttribute("href"); // "www.google.com"
link.setAttribute("href", "www.dogs.com");
```

#### DOM Events

Events are everywhere, like click the mouse, press the keyboard, hover over a link, drag and drop. The process is that first select an element, then add an event listener. An element can have several event listeners.

**element.addEventListener\(type, function\): **Given the type of event we want to listen and function to execute when the event happen, we add an event listener to that element.

**element.removeEventListener\(type, function\): **remove the event listener of certain type and function from element.

```js
var button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", clicked);
button.removeEventListener("click",clicked);
function clicked(){console.log("Button has been clicked!")};
```

[**Event Types**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)**: **

**"click": **fires when an element is clicked by user.** **

**"change": **when a change to the element value is committed by the user. eg. &lt;input&gt; &lt;select&gt; &lt;textarea&gt;. The difference between "change" and "input" event is change event is not necessarily fired for each change to an element's value.

**"input": **when a change to the element value is changed. eg. &lt;input&gt;&lt;select&gt;&lt;textarea&gt;. This event fires more often.

**"mouseover": **fires when the mouse hover over this element.

**"mouseout": **fires when the mouse hover out this element

## 5. jQuery

jQuery is a javascript library, or DOM manipulation library. It have many useful methods like: select elements, manipulate elements, create elements, add event listener, animate elements, add effects, make http requests\(AJAX\), etc.

The reason why we use jQuery is: \(1\) Fixes "broken" DOM API \(2\) Brevity and Clarity \(3\) Cross browser support \(4\) AJAX.

To add jQuery to HTML and CSS, use a `<script>` tag to link CDN or local file to html header.

**jQuery Selector:**`$("CSS-style selector")` will return a list of all the elements that matches the css-style selector.  it's similar to document.querySelectorAll\(\).

`$("selector:first")` or `$(selector).first()`: select the first element that matches the selector

`$(selector).last()`: select the last element in the list

#### Manipulation:

A big difference is that we can manipulate using jQuery methods to a collection of elements without for loop. It automatically apply the method to all selected elements. Secondly, each method in jQuery is both a getter and a setter, so be careful about distinguish which function does it use.

**Style Property: **`$("selector").css("property", "value")`.css\(\) method is jQuery's interface to styling. You can either add an object in CSS\(\) too. The style will effect on every element selected in the list, we don't need to write a for loop.

**addClass\("class1 class2"\): **add the specific class or classes to the list of matched elements

**removeClass\("className"\): **remove the specific class or classes to the list of matched elements

**toggleClass\("className"\): **add the class if not exist or remove the class if existed in the matched elements

```js
// get the value of width of img
var width = $("img").css("width");

// change all <a> 's background color to blue
$("a").css("backgroundColor", "blue"); 
// change all element in class "selected" to these styles
$(".selected").css({border: "1px solid blue", color: "purple"});
```

**Text and Content:**

**text\("new text"\):** get or set the combined text \(a single string\) content of each element in the list of matched elements, including their descendant. It's similar to `element.textContent`

**html\("new html"\): **get the html contents of the first element in the list of matched elements, or set the html contents of every matched element. It's similar to `element.innerHTML`

```js
// get the text content of body
var body = $(body).text();

// set the text of all list to "You are the best"
$("li").text("You are the best");
$("h1").html("<strong>Nobody</strong> can destroy <em>you<em>");
```

**Attribute and Value: **

**attr\("attribute name", "new value"\): **get the value of an attribute for the first element in the list of matched elements, or set one or more attributes for every matched element. It's similar to `element.getAttribute()` and `element.setAttribute()`

```js
// get the link address of the first <a> 
var link = $("a").attr("href");

// set the type of input to button
$("input").attr("type", "button");
$("input").attr({type: "text", placeholder:"your name"});
```

**val\("new value"\): **get the value of the first element in the list of matched element, or set the value of every matched element. it's like a wrapper for value, text\(\) is a wrapper for text content. It's similar to `element.value`

```js
// get the value of text input
$("input:text").val()
$("select").val // get the value of a dropdown menu

// set the value of number input
$("input:number").val("4")
```

**"This" keyword:** in jQuery, this is written as `$(this)`

#### jQuery Event

**click\(function\): **add a click listener to element.

**keydown/keypress/keyup\(function\): **function will be triggered** **when the key is pressed down/between key down and key up/when the key is relieved, it's used to add a key listener to element. keyup\(\) and keydown\(\) provide a code indicating which key is pressed. While keypress indicates which character was entered, like a lowercase 'a' will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup, but as 97 by keypress. an uppercase 'A' = keypress shift + 'a' will be reported as 65 by all events. Every key have its own keycode. we can search which key was pressed by event.which.

```js
// The console will show "You hit enter" every time you press enter key 
// the first argument of keypress callback function is an event object 
$(input).keypress(function(event) {
    if (event.which === 13) {
        console.log("You hit enter");
    }
});
```

**on\(type, function\): **let you specify the type of event to listen for, similar to addEventListener\(\).

**Difference between click\(\) and on\("click"\):** click\(\) will only add listener for existing element, on\("click"\) will add listener for all potential future elements. Usually, we use on\("click"\) rather than click\(\) to make all potential elements to add listeners.

```js
$("button").on("click", function(){
    console.log("button clicked!");
});
```

**Some Events:** "mouseenter", "mouseleave", "dbclick"\(double click\),

#### jQuery Effect

**fadeOut\(duration, function\):** hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. It can fade in the duration time period and also execute a function when the animation complete.

**fadeIn\(duration, function\): **we can first set some element's style as "display: none", then fade it in to the page.

**fadeToggle\(duration, function\): **if the element is on display currently, fade it out. else if it's not on display, fade it in.

```js
// all div will fade out when button is clicked, the animation will last 1s
// after the animation is completed, remove all div
$(button).on("click", function() {
    $("div").fadeOut(1000, function(){
        $(this).remove() ;
    });
});
```

**slideDown\(\): **animated the height of an element, display the matched elements with a sliding down motion

**slideUp\(\): **hide** **the matched elements with a sliding up motion.

**slideToggle\(\): **if the element is on display, hide it, else if the element is not on display, show it.

[**Paper JavaScript**](http://paperjs.org/tutorials/)

It's an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of HTML canvas. It offers a clean document object model and a powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics.

[**Howler JavaScript**](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js)

It's an audio library for the modern web. It defaults to Web Audio API and falls back to HTML5 Audio. This makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.

**Notice**

In oder to get rid of the Cross Origin errors in the console, you'll need to run a local HTTP server from your project's directory and load the circles.html file from there. The steps are: \(1\) Navigate to your project folder in the terminal \(2\) Run `python -m simpleHTTPServer`\(3\) open up your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) \(4\) select the html file

# Backend Part

## 1. Backend Basics

**Process of entering an url to browser:**

\(1\) query ISP\(Internet service provider\) + DNS\(Domain Name Service\), get the IP address for the domain name

\(2\) send an HTTP request to the IP address

\(3\) server get the request and builds up the right content by pulling data from database, then send a HTTP response to the user

\(4\) browser receive the HTTP response and render the page

#### **Static vs. Dynamic Website**

**Static Website: **runs the same html, css, javascript file every time. It will never be different.

**Dynamic Website: **sites that are compiled on the server side where the server is constructing the webpage before it sends back response. The website is dynamic for different user and timestamp.

#### Generic Web Technology Stack

**Frontend: **HTML, CSS, Javascript

**Backend: **Backend language\(Java, Python, NodeJS\), Framework\(Flask, Spring, Express\), Server\(Tomcat\), Database\(MySQL, MongoDB\)

#### HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

**HTTP Request:** There are many HTTP request API, eg. Get, Post, Put, Delete. We can make a HTTP Get request by url, we need a html form to make a HTTP post request.

**HTTP Response: **Response is consists of body and header.** **Body includes main content \(all html, css and javascript files\). Headers contains the metadata about the response. One of header data is status code, a number that represent the status of whole response cycle.

**Server Code Structure:** \(1\) Set up server \(2\) Set up database \(3\) Routes \(4\) Start the server

## 2. The Command Line

**cd**: change to another directory/path  
**ls**: list all the files and directories in current directory  
**touch**: create a new file, it could be any form, for example .java .txt .xls  
**mkdir**: create a new directory  
**rm**: remove a file  
**rmdir/rm - rf**: remove a directory. rm -rf can delete non-empty directory while rmdir can't.

## 3. Node JavaScript

Originally, javascript is used only for browser, which means it can only be used in frontend side.  
NodeJS enable us to write javascript on both frontend side and server side

To enter node, open terminal and enter node. To quit node, enter control+c twice. To run a file with node, just type `node filename.js`to the terminal.

Notice that some functions that is only for browser won't work in node.js, because node.js works in server side, there is no browser on server side. eg. alert\(\), document object model\(DOM\), selector, manipulation.

**REPL:** Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

#### npm - Node Package Manager

npm is the package manager for javascript. Package is same with libraries, it is code that someone else written that you can add to your own code, like Bootstrap, jQuery, Paper.js, Howler.js. But we can't use `<script>` tag to link them since we don't have html file.

To install a package, type command line `npm install packageName`

To import a package, assign a variable `var name = require("packageName");` in your js file

## 4. Server Side Framework

**Library: **It's a collection of functions\(routines\) or classes. The reason behind is simply code reuse. The routines and classes normally define specific operations in a domain specific area.

**Framework: **It's also external code that you include in you application, framework provides a standard way to build and deploy application. In framework, all the control flow is already there, and there are bunch of predefined white spots that we should fill out with our code. A framework is normally more complex. It defines a skeleton where the application defines its own features to fill out the skeleton. In this way, your code will be called by the framework when appropriately. The benefit is that developers do not need to worry about if a design is good or not, but just about implementing domain specific functions.

**Key Difference between Framework and Library: "**Inversion of control": When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted, the framework calls you. It's called the "Hollywood Principle": Don't call us, we call you.

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DqCkT.png)

**Heavy weight vs. Light weight framework:** heavy weight framework write most of the code for you, you just need to fill in a few blanks, light weight framework have more blanks and let you fill in your code more often.

#### [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com/)

a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework that provide a robust set of features for web and mobile application.

Install express framework by `npm install express --save`

**Route:** server side code that are responsible for listening and receiving HTTP request and deciding what to send back as a response.

```js
// import and initialize express, save it to a variable
var express = require("express"); // import express
var app = express(); // execute express and initial it to a variable

//Define routes  app.httpMethod("url(route path)", callback function(request, respond){})
app.get("/bye", function(req, res) {
    res.send("Goodbye");
});

// add a listener to the certain Port and Ip address request(start the server)
app.listen(process.env.PORT, process.env.IP, function(){
    console.log("The server has start");
});
```

**package.json**: all npm package contains "package.json", it holds metadata relevant to the project. It give the information to nmp that allows it to identify the project and handle project dependencies. project dependency is the package you need to install before you install this package. It's like a recipes for a meal.

If we create a new package of our own, go to the package folder and type command line `npm init` , the terminal will walk you through to create a new package.json file for this package. And if you install any package using `npm install packageName --save`.The package.json file's package dependency will automatically add the package name and version you installed. so that you don't need to update package.json by yourself.

**"\*" Router Matcher**: it will catch all route path that doesn't exist,  and execute the same callback function, like "page not found", etc. The order of this route function matters, because if you put it before other routes function, then all the page will go to "\*". Because the first route that matches the url request will only be run. So normally, we put it in the end.

```js
app.get("*", function(req, res) {
    res.send("Sorry, page not found... What are you doing with your life?");
})
```

**Route Params:** we don't want to write a function for every different route, instead we want to find a pattern and execute the function to every url that matches that pattern. So we need route parameter to represent that pattern.

```js
// "/speak/:animal" will take all the str after "speak/" as a parameter called animal
// we get the string value from req.params.animal. Then find the corresponding sound for that animal.
app.get("/speak/:animal", function(req, res){
    var animal = req.params.animal.toLowerCase();
    var sounds = {
        pig:"'Oink'", 
        cow:"'Moo'", 
        dog:"'Woof Woof!'"};
    res.send("The " + animal + " says " + sounds[animal]);
});
```

**res.render\("fileName", object\)**: a method used to send back content of a file, the file need to exist in a directory called "views", res will automatically looks for the file in that directory. To pass data to ejs template, we create an object, link all data send in request to its corresponding variable name in ejs template. so that the page will be loaded dynamically.

[**Embedded JavaScript \(ejs\)**](http://ejs.co/)

EJS enable us to have dynamic templates, we can embed some javascript code inside html file, for every line of javascript use`<% %>`to tell the browser, it's a embedded javascript code.

Before using ejs template, install ejs in npm: `npm install ejs --save`

`<%  %>`: it won't display the value returned, it just execute the logic like control flow, loop, if statement

`<%= %>`: it will render the value that is returned by javascript to HTML

`<%- %>`

**EJS Control Flow: **you must have `<% %>`  in every line for javascript

```js
// ejs if statement
<% if (name.toLowerCase() == "chang") { %>
<p> Good Choice, Chang is the Best! </p>
<% } else { %>
<p>Bad choice, you should have choose Chang.</p>
<% }%>

// ejs for loop
<% for (var i = 0; i < posts.length; i++) { %>
    <li>
        <%= posts[i].title%>  -  <strong><%=posts[i].author%></strong> 
    </li>
<% } %>
```

**Serving Custom Assets**

The css and javascript file stores in a directory called "public", all webpage's ejs file stores in a directory called "views", the header and footer are stored in a directory under "views" called "partials". To add header and footer, use `<% include partials/finelName %>`.when add css link, don't forget to add "/" before file name, which shows find css file under root directory.

```js
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

// add "public" directory to app, so it will automatically look for public
app.use(express.static("public"));
// set view engine so that we don't need to write "home.ejs" every time. 
app.set("view engine", "ejs");

app.get("/r/:name", function(req, res){
    var name = req.params.name;
    res.render("home", {nameVar: name}); // No need to write "home.ejs"
});
```

```html
<!--in here can't use "/partials/header" because partials is inside views directory-->
<%include partials/header%>  <!--Attach header.ejs-->
<!--can't use "/public/app.css", because express will find public itself-->
<!--very important to have a slash before app.css, which means look for app.css in the root directory, not the same with views directory-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/app.css"> 

<h1>This is the home page for <%= nameVar %></h1>
<p> Do you know 5 + 5 = ?  It's <%= 5 + 5 %></p>
<img src="https://timeincsecure-a.akamaihd.net/rtmp_uds/416418724/201705/2262/416418724_5444908038001_5444174709001-vs.jpg?pubId=416418724&videoId=5444174709001">
<%include partials/footer%>   <!--Attach footer.ejs-->
```

**Post Handle Request:**

In ejs file, we need to create a form and define the "action" and "method" property, in javascript, we define a new post route, get the data from  req.body, and add it to the dataset, then redirect to original page.

We need to install "body-parser" package. `npm install body-parser --save`

```js
var bodyParser = require("body-parser");
var friends = ["Tony", "Justin", "Miranda", "Fan", "Bob"];

// make app use body parser to make req.body a javascript object
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));
app.set("view engine", "ejs");

app.post("/addfriend", function(req, res){
    // extract friend name from req.body
    var newfriend = req.body.newfriend;
    // add it to the list
    friends.push(newfriend);
    // redirect to "/friends" page
    res.redirect("/friends"); 
});

app.get("/friends", function(req, res){
    res.render("friends", {friends:friends});
});
```

```html
<!--Once hit submit, the form value will sent to this url by post http method-->
<form action="/addfriend" method="post">
    <label>Friend Name:<input type="text" placeholder="name" name="newfriend"></label>
    <button>I made a new friend!</button>
</form>
```

#### **API - Application Programming Interface**

It's ways for you to write code that interact with other application services. Web API is api that you interact with through the web \(http request\).

If we make HTTP request by website domain, we will get HTML back. It contains the structure of a page. If we make HTTP request by web API URL, it respond with data, in the format of XML or JSON.

**XML - Extended Markup Language**

Its syntax is similar to HTML, but it doesn't describe structure, it represent data key-value pair. There is no functional tag.

```markdown
<person>
    <name>Travis</name>
    <age>21</age>
    <city>Los Angeles</city>
</person>
```

**JSON - JavaScript Object Notation**

JSON likes exactly like JavaScript Object, but key is also a string.

```js
{
 "person" :{
    "name": "Travis", 
    "age": "21",
    "city": "Los Angeles"        
 } 
}
```

**Request Package: **in order to send http request in a code program, we need to install a package called request `npm install request --save`

**JSON.parse\(string\): **the body we get from request argument is not JSON, it's a string. We need to transfer it to JSON using this method.

```js
var request = require("request");
request("https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20astronomy.sunset%20from%20weather.forecast%20where%20woeid%20in%20(select%20woeid%20from%20geo.places(1)%20where%20text%3D%22maui%2C%20hi%22)&format=json&env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys", function(error, response, body){
    if (error) {
        console.log(error);
    } else if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        var parsed = JSON.parse(body); // parse string the JSON
        console.log("Today's sunset time in Hawaii is ");
        console.log(parsed["query"]["results"]["channel"]["astronomy"]["sunset"]);
    }
});
```
