QT += core gui

```

```cpp
#include <QApplication>
#include <QLabel>
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // create a QApplication object
    QApplication.app(argc, argv);
    QLabel *label = new QLabel("Hello Workd");

#### Why do you think you will fit in this position?

First of all, Synopsys is the world's No. 1 electronic design automation tools and services company, and FPGA is one of the most important product of Synopsys. I myself majored in electrical engineer in undergrad, have relative knowledge about logic gate and analog circuit.

Second, I'm very interested in GUI, I have learned Qt framework by watching tutorial video online.
