#### Why do you want to join Synopsys?

First of all, Synopsys is the world's No. 1 company that provide electronic design automation tools and services, and FPGA is one of the most important product of Synopsys. I myself majored in electrical engineer in undergrad and graduate school, I have basic analog circuit background knowledge about basic digit and analog circuit.

Second, I'm very interested in GUI, I have learned Qt framework by watching tutorial video online.  Also I have both frontend and backend website development experience, which I think is very similar to graphical interface design process. I can start hands-on project very soon.

Third, I am a team player and very willing to communicate with other development team and application engineer. I'd like to be part of the team and share my stories to the team. 

#### Why do you want to work in OfferUp?
First of all, OfferUp is the fastest growing mobile marketplace, the users are very loyal. people can sell things they no longer needed and buy products they want to have in a good price. It definitely makes people’s life more convenient and make second hand products more valuable. I am willing to grow up with OfferUp together and I know that I can learn a lot in this fast-paced startup.

Second, I have many ideas about adding more features to make OfferUp more popular and widely-used. For example, we can held some sales event, reward the users who sell or buy products through OfferUp during that period. In University, many new students need to buy and sell furniture in the beginning or end of the semester, we can encourage them to buy and sell through OfferUp to get cash reward. In the community, we can also hold online and offline garage sales. It can help people in the same community know each other.

Third, I like the neighborly culture in OfferUp. Because I have many hobbies like hiking, watching movies and exploring new restaurants. I like to share it with my colleagues and become friend with each other. Becoming friends with colleagues make us easier to understand with each other and cooperate better in work. 

#### Why Yelp?

I myself use yelp every day. When I want to go out to a good restaurant with friends or do hair salon but don’t know which one is a wise choice, I will open yelp app to search for a restaurant or hair salon with good rating. When I arrived at the restaurant and don’t know which course to order, I will open yelp app to see the food picture and customers review. Yelp definitely makes people’s life better. I will be very honored to be a part of it. 

Also, I know that yelp emphasis teamwork very much. I really like working and learning from excellent engineers with brilliant brains.  I have worked with many teammates during undergrad and graduate school. Almost every team mates will be a good. 

Another thing that attracts me is that Yelp’s office is ranked as “the Greatest Place to Work”.

#### Do you have any product suggestion to yelp?

1. Provide personalized recommendation.
Currently the restaurant you can search on yelp are the same for everyone due to their location. Since we have many information of our users, like which restaurant they have book marked, which restaurant have they visited, which restaurant they give good or bad rates, which restaurant their friends visited. We can use this information to make personal recommendation like Amazon.
2. Visualize data
Most content in yelp is text review and rating numbers. We can visualize the data to reveal how popular a restaurant is. For example, draw a pie chart or segment chart to see how many people visit this restaurant this week. 

3. Merge yelp with Facebook
If I have visited a nice restaurant and want to share it with my friend, most of the people would like to post it in Facebook. If they can share a yelp restaurant page with their friends, then other people can directly bookmark it on yelp.

#### What things you care about most for your first full-time job?  
As a new graduate, the thing that I care about most is that whether I can learn a lot in this company, can this position can make me grow fast, is there many opportunities provided for promotion, Is the project challenging or just boring. 


#### Why do you fit in this position?
First, I studied Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Web Technology in USC. The skills and background for data structure and algorithm I learned is suitable for this position.

The position requires to use java or python to do coding. I have experience in both language.  I have hands on experience in web-scale application, like Eatup - a restaurant recommendation website. 

This position need to cooperate with frontend developer and product manager to design new features. I am a good team player and like to communicate with other. So I believe I fit in this position.


#### Did you have any conflicts during your project and how do you handle it?

In my junior year in undergrad, I was the team leader of project for mathematic modeling. We need to build a model to predict future electrical market price. When we are choosing models, my teammates think random forest is a good model, but I want to choose linear regression. 

So I talk to the teammate privately, and said his model may have high accuracy but it takes much more time to train it. So I suggest that we could choose a basic model to guarantee a result, then optimize the model later if we have time. 

The teammate think it makes sense, so we use linear regression in a short time and then we still have time to improve it. We get a good score in that project.

#### How do you persuade others?

In my first year of master degree, I joined graduated student association in USC, we need to design a poster for Halloween Ball Event. My colleague design the first version of the poster, but I am not very satisfied with the content and pictures he used. So I talked to him, first I appreciate his hard work effort, and said I like the design and font he chose. Then I said that I had some suggestions that might make the poster more attractive, first we can change the apply link to QR code, so it will be easier to scan. Then we could make the background color as black, which is more suitable for Halloween. He thought these are good ideas and takes my advice. It turns out that our event attracts more people than we expect.

#### How do you handle failure?

In my senior year in undergrad, I hope to do research with a very good professor in signal and image processing direction. However the professor rejected me because there are other students with more relevance experience than me applied for it. So I went to the library and read recent papers this professor wrote. And came up with a point about how to compressing image with less resolution lose. Then I discuss this problem with the professor and tell him my ideas to solve this problem. He thought it is a very good research direction and finally accept to let me do research with him.

#### How do you solve a problem that you don't know in the project?
I usually use StackOverflow, Quora, Paper, Github when I have technical problems. Most of the problems have answers on google.
