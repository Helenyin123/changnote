#### Why do you want to join Synopsys?

First of all, Synopsys is the world's No. 1 company that provide electronic design automation tools and services, and FPGA is one of the most important product of Synopsys. I myself majored in electrical engineer in undergrad and graduate school, I have basic analog circuit background knowledge about basic digit and analog circuit.

Second, I'm very interested in GUI, I have learned Qt framework by watching tutorial video online.  Also I have both frontend and backend website development experience, which I think is very similar to graphical interface design process. I can start hands-on project very soon.

Third, I am a team player and very willing to communicate with other development team and application engineer. I'd like to be part of the team and share my stories to the team. 


#### Why do you fit in this position?
First, I studied Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Web Technology in USC. The skills and background for data structure and algorithm I learned is suitable for this position.

The position requires to use java or python to do coding. I have experience in both language.  I have hands on experience in web-scale application, like Eatup - a restaurant recommendation website. 

This position need to cooperate with frontend developer and product manager to design new features. I am a good team player and like to communicate with other. So I believe I fit in this position.


#### Did you have any conflicts during your project and how do you handle it?

In my junior year in undergrad, I was the team leader of project for mathematic modeling. We need to build a model to predict future electrical market price. When we are choosing models, my teammates think random forest is a good model, but I want to choose linear regression. 

So I talk to the teammate privately, and said his model may have high accuracy but it takes much more time to train it. So I suggest that we could choose a basic model to guarantee a result, then optimize the model later if we have time. 

The teammate think it makes sense, so we use linear regression in a short time and then we still have time to improve it. We get a good score in that project.

#### How do you persuade others?

In my first year of master degree, I joined graduated student association in USC, we need to design a poster for Halloween Ball Event. My colleague design the first version of the poster, but I am not very satisfied with the content and pictures he used. So I talked to him, first I appreciate his hard work effort, and said I like the design and font he chose. Then I said that I had some suggestions that might make the poster more attractive, first we can change the apply link to QR code, so it will be easier to scan. Then we could make the background color as black, which is more suitable for Halloween. He thought these are good ideas and takes my advice. It turns out that our event attracts more people than we expect.

#### How do you handle failure?

In my senior year in undergrad, I hope to do research with a very good professor in signal and image processing direction. However the professor rejected me because there are other students with more relevance experience than me applied for it. So I went to the library and read recent papers this professor wrote. And came up with a point about how to compressing image with less resolution lose. Then I discuss this problem with the professor and tell him my ideas to solve this problem. He thought it is a very good research direction and finally accept to let me do research with him.

#### How do you solve a problem that you don't know in the project?
I usually use StackOverflow, Quora, Paper, Github when I have technical problems. Most of the problems have answers on google.
