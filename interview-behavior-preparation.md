#### Why do you want to join Synopsys?

First of all, Synopsys is the world's No. 1 company that provide electronic design automation tools and services, and FPGA is one of the most important product of Synopsys. I myself majored in electrical engineer in undergrad and graduate school, I have basic analog circuit background knowledge about basic digit and analog circuit.

Second, I'm very interested in GUI, I have learned Qt framework by watching tutorial video online.  Also I have both frontend and backend website development experience, which I think is very similar to graphical interface design process. I can start hands-on project very soon.

Third, I am a team player and very willing to communicate with other development team and application engineer. I'd like to be part of the team and share my stories to the team.
